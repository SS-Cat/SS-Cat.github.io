        This paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>right.</strong> 
        It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does 
        not get too close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you 
        should always add a few pixels between words and borders, images, 
        and other content. <br>

        This text is inside the div element, which has a blue 
        background color and is floated to the left. We set a specific 
        height and width for the div element, and as you can see, 
        the content cannot fit.
